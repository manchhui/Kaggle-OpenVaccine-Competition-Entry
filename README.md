# Kaggle-OpenVaccine-Competition-Entry
## Introduction
In this competition, the organisers were looking to leverage the data science expertise of the Kaggle community to develop models and design rules for RNA degradation. The developed models will predict likely degradation rates at each base of an RNA molecule, trained on a subset of an Eterna dataset comprising over 3000 RNA molecules (which span a panoply of sequences and structures) and their degradation rates at each position.
